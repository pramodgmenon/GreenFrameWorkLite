$index_content = 'Hi <br/><br/>

This is <A href="http://www.legreensolutions.com" target="_blank">LegreenSolutions</A> first attempt to create simple FrameWork called <strong>"Green FrameWork"</strong>. This is not a complete frame work like CAKE PHP, CI, etc... Here we try to separate presentation layer from coding, there by simplifying programmers and designers jobs. We tried to create a system which help the administrator to edit the static text, messages (both info and error) online. No need to edit the code !!!. <strong>"Green FrameWork"</strong> also support multi-language (for static text and messages only)<br/>

This project is under testing. We would like to invite your suggestion to make this effort successful.<br/><br/>


Please clone Git Repository for testing<br/>
