Hi



This is LegreenSolutions first attempt to create simple FrameWork called "Green FrameWork". This is not a complete frame work like CAKE PHP, CI, etc... Here we try to separate presentation layer from coding, there by simplifying programme's and designers jobs. 


This project is under testing. We would like to invite your suggestion to make this effort successful.


Please clone Git Repository for testing
---------------------------------------
git clone git@github.com:pramodgmenon/GreenFrameWorkLite.git

Regards,

Team LegreenSolutions.
