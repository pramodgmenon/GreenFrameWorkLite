Hi



This is LegreenSolutions first attempt to create simple FrameWork called "Green FrameWork". This is not a complete frame work like CAKE PHP, CI, etc... Here we try to separate presentation layer from coding, there by simplifying programme's and designers jobs. We tried to create a system which help the administrator to edit the static text, messages (both info and error) online. No need to edit the code !!!. "Green FrameWork" also support multi-language (for static text and messages only)


This project is under testing. We would like to invite your suggestion to make this effort successful.


Please clone Git Repository for testing
